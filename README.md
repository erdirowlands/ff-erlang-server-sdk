Erlang SDK For Harness Feature Flags
========================

[Harness](https://www.harness.io/) is a feature management platform that helps
teams to build better software and to test features quicker.

This repository contains our Feature Flags SDK for Erlang and other BEAM
languages such as Elixir.

## Intro

This sample doesnâ€™t include configuration
options. For in depth steps and configuring the SDK, e.g. disabling
streaming or using our Relay Proxy, see the 
[Erlang SDK Reference](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/hwoxb6x2oe-Erlang-sdk-reference).

For a sample FF Erlang SDK project, see our
[test Erlang project](examples/getting_started/getting_started.erl).

For a sample FF Erlang SDK Project for Elixir, see our
[test Elixir Project](https://github.com/harness/ff-elixir-server-sample).

## Requirements

Erlang OTP 22 or newer.

## Quickstart

To follow along with our test code sample, make sure you have:

- [Created a Feature Flag on the Harness Platform](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/1j7pdkqh7j-create-a-feature-flag)
  called `harnessappdemodarkmode`
- [Created a server SDK key and made a copy of it](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/1j7pdkqh7j-create-a-feature-flag#step_3_create_an_sdk_key)

### Install the SDK (Erlang)

Add this library as a dependency to your `rebar.config`.

```erlang
{deps, [
  {cfclient, {git, "https://github.com/harness/ff-erlang-server-sdk", {branch, "0.1.0"}}}
]}.
```

Add the dependency to your project's `app.src`.
```erlang
{applications,
  [kernel, stdlib, cfclient]
},
```

### Install the SDK (Elixir)

Add the library to `mix.exs` `deps()`:

```elixir
{:cfclient, github: "harness/ff-erlang-server-sdk"},
```

## Configuration

### Erlang

Configure the application environment in `sys.config`:

```erlang
[
  {cfclient, [
      {api_key, "b4fb299b-767c-4ccf-ad0a-b1ab06c987c3"},
  ]}
].
```

### Elixir

Configure the application environment in e.g. `config/dev.exs`:

```elixir
config :cfclient,
  api_key: "b4fb299b-767c-4ccf-ad0a-b1ab06c987c3"
```


Normally there is a single project per application. If different parts of
your application need their own key, then you can start up additional client
instances, passing in a `name` and `api_key` for each. When you call
client API functions, pass the name as the first parameter.

### Code Sample

The following is a complete code example that you can use to test the
`harnessappdemodarkmode` flag you created via harness.io. When you run
the code it will:

- Connect to the FF service.
- Report the value of the Flag every 10 seconds until the connection is closed.
  Every time the harnessappdemodarkmode Flag is toggled on or off on the
  Harness Platform, the updated value is reported.

```erlang
-module(getting_started).

get_flag() ->
  Target = #{
    identifier => "Harness_Target_1",
    name => "HT_1",

    % Attribute keys must be atoms. 
    % Values must be either binaries, atoms, or a list of binaries/atoms -
    % see Targets with custom attributes section below.
    attributes => #{email => <<"demo@harness.io">>}
  },
  FlagIdentifier = "harnessappdemodarkmode",
  Result = cfclient:bool_variation(FlagIdentifier, Target, false),
  logger:info("Varaion for Flag ~p witih Target ~p is: ~p~n",
    [FlagIdentifier, maps:get(identifier, Target), Result]),
  timer:sleep(10000),
  get_flag().
```

### Running the example

In the SDK project directory run the following:

```console
rebar3 shell
1> getting_started:start("YOUR SDK KEY").
Erlang SDK Successfuly Started
Varaion for Flag "harnessappdemodarkmode" witih Target "Harness_Target_1" is: true
```

### Targets with custom attributes

You can use the `attributes` map to provide custom attributes. If the Target
isn't anonymous, the attributes will shortly appear in the Harness UI after an
evaluation using the Target.
You can create [Group Rules](https://docs.harness.io/article/5qz1qrugyk-add-target-groups)
based on these attributes.

Note: `attribute` keys must be `atoms` and the values must either be `binaries`
or `atoms` or a list of `binaries` or `atoms`.

```erlang
  TargetBetaGroup = #{'identifier' => <<"my_target">>,
    name => <<"my_target_name">>,
    anonymous => <<"">>,
    attributes => #{beta => <<"beta_group_1">>}
    },
  TargetBetaGroups = #{'identifier' => <<"my_other_target">>,
    name => <<"my_other_target_name">>,
    anonymous => <<"">>,
    attributes => #{beta => [<<"beta_group_1">>, 'beta_group_2'}]}
    },
  TargetAlphaGroup = #{'identifier' => <<"my_alpha_target">>,
    name => <<"my_alpha_target_name">>,
    anonymous => <<"">>,
    attributes => #{alpha => 'alpha_group_1'}
    },
```
